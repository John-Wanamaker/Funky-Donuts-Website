# Funky-Donuts

This is a website for fun, but displays useful tools back coded using with PHP, PHPmyadmin, MongoDB, mySQL, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
Some main functions are: 
- Adds user to a mySQL database when they register on the website. It encrypts the password to the databse
- The user can then login and it shows their name on all pages.
- A daily quote displays by parsing a JSON file from a Mongo databse.
- Decrements value of units in stock for each product after purchase. 
- Auto updating date and time in banner using JQUERY/AJAX.
- A feedback form that sends a formatted email to both the sender and reciever.
- and Much More!
If you download this code, the backend databse won't work as I'm hiding my mongodb.inc and mysqldb.inc files 
that include database access information for security reasons. Incorperate these files with your information 
and you will get to experience modern website functions such as the register/login.
